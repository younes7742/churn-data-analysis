## 📊 Project Overview

Customer churn (when customers stop using a service) is a critical metric for businesses to understand and reduce.  
This project focuses on:

- Understanding factors influencing customer churn.
- Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
- Visualizing data patterns and relationships.
- Building and evaluating classification models to predict churn.
- Tuning models for improved performance.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- Python  
  - Pandas (data manipulation)  
  - Scikit-learn (machine learning modeling and evaluation)  
  - Seaborn & Matplotlib (data visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook (interactive analysis and reporting)

## 🚀 Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with insightful visualizations.  
- Multiple machine learning models (e.g., SVC, Logistic Regression) with performance comparison.  
- Threshold tuning and confusion matrix analysis to balance precision and recall.  
- Clear, commented, and structured Python code for reproducibility.
